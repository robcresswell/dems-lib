# {{ name }}

A repo for quickly scripting some things in TS. Has a strict TS setup with some
linting for correctness hints, several helpful libraries for working with APIs,
and some basic string colour utilities for output.

## Getting started

```console
./run.sh
```

### Linting

Run the code linting tasks with

```
yarn lint
```

You can also format / autofix many linting issues with

```
yarn lint:fix
```
